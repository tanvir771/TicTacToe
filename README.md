# TicTacToe
Overview

Welcome to the TicTacToe project! This is a graphical implementation of the classic TicTacToe game using Pygame, a popular Python library for game development. The project aims to provide an interactive and enjoyable gaming experience for players, with an added twist of AI-based gameplay.
Features

    Graphical Interface: The game features a user-friendly graphical interface created using Pygame, enhancing the gaming experience with visuals and animations.

    Object-Oriented Design: The project is developed using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, promoting modularity and code organization. Each component of the game is encapsulated within classes, making the codebase more maintainable and extensible.

    AI Gameplay with Minimax Algorithm: One of the highlights of this project is the incorporation of the Minimax algorithm for AI-based gameplay. Players can now challenge an intelligent opponent, testing their skills against a computer that employs strategic decision-making to play the game optimally.

Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the TicTacToe game up and running on your local machine:

    Prerequisites:
