   <h1>TicTacToe Game with Pygame</h1>
   ![Game-Running](Screenshots/Game_Running.png)
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the TicTacToe project! This is a graphical implementation of the classic TicTacToe game using Pygame, a popular Python library for game development. The project aims to provide an interactive and enjoyable gaming experience for players, with an added twist of AI-based gameplay.</p>
    <h2>Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Graphical Interface:</strong> The game features a user-friendly graphical interface created using Pygame, enhancing the gaming experience with visuals and animations.</li>
        <li><strong>Object-Oriented Design:</strong> The project is developed using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, promoting modularity and code organization. Each component of the game is encapsulated within classes, making the codebase more maintainable and extensible.</li>
        <li><strong>AI Gameplay with Minimax Algorithm:</strong> One of the highlights of this project is the incorporation of the Minimax algorithm for AI-based gameplay. Players can now challenge an intelligent opponent, testing their skills against a computer that employs strategic decision-making to play the game optimally.</li>
    </ul>
